        <div className="content col-lg-10">
            <p>Humanity has always been very particular about Progress and prosperity. Along with time, our meaning of Progress may have changed. But the art of achieving it remains the same. It is the art of ‘Living in Society’. It is the same art which helped us evolve into our modern society. Be it a milestone innovation or an emergency during natural calamities, we were always together and had one for each other. </p>

            <p>Abhyuday, the Social Body of IIT Bombay, started in 2014 with a group of socially inclined students who felt the need for a social body.  The family grew, creating and providing opportunities for the institute's students who wish to work for a better society. After the tremendous response from the institute's students, Abhyuday started to scale up its programs on a national level, widening its horizons.  </p>

            <p>With a vision to channel the youth toward social challenges in India, Abhyuday has established itself as one of the country’s largest student-run social bodies in the past ten years. The journey was challenging yet rewarding. In this decade's journey, Abhyuday touched millions of lives and has been the cause of many happy faces.
            </p>

            <p>We organise the programs of Abhyuday broadly under three categories: Campaigns, Events and Competitions. While campaigns, the face of Abhyuday, are conducted throughout the year, Events and Competitions, spanning from days to weeks, provide opportunities for our youth to showcase their talent and create a positive impact around them.</p>

            <p>Apart from these activities, Abhyuday organises an Annual Social Fest every year. The ‘Social Fest’ is a two-day grand showcase depicting the spirit of good cause via various events like talk shows, workshops, panel discussions, street plays, etc. and competitions. It is usually held on the third/ fourth weekend of January.</p>

            <p>Abhyuday’s Annual Social Festival inculcates various impactful events, exhibitions, competitions, talk sessions and workshops to instil a sense of responsibility in the youth towards society. These activities help us create awareness about fundamental human rights, prevailing social issues, their solutions and the responsibility of the youth.  </p>

            <p>The 10th edition of the Annual Social Fest will be held on the 21st and 22nd of January 2023 based on the theme “A Locus of Resilience”.  The Social Fest 2023 strengthens the belief that we can rise back from hard times to the zenith of glory through consistent human efforts and make the world a better place. The Social Fest will create awareness and impact through topics like blockchain, cybercrime awareness, financial literacy, emotional intelligence, health and many more.</p>

            <p>Throughout the history of India and world, there were many instances where human integrity and strength were put to test. Time being the testimony, these struggles experienced many sacrifices, reforms and led to some remarkable developments. Be it the well-known Chipko movement of India, French Revolution or the recent Black lives matter movement from the United States, each of these struggles brought a new perspective and taught a new lesson to us. </p>

            <p>With continuous efforts and resilience, the people who were a part of these protests & revolts were able to take one step at a time towards a common goal. The Annual Fest 2023 with the theme A Locus of Resilience commemorates these struggles and persistent efforts of people which made our history.
